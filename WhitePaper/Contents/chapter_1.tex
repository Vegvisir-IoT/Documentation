\abstract*{General Abstractions is the overview of all the state machine. The
mechanisms describe are required for the Vegvisir structure to be enabled to
work as described in the original paper. It is possible to have additional
methods or functions within an agent.}

\section{The State Machine}
\label{sec:1}
A state machine can be generally described as an autonomous agent that is
encoded with variables to define its state. The machine transitions to
different states by when given commands. In Vegvisir, the state machine is
responsible for managing two items:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Blockdag
    \item CRDT List
\end{enumerate}
