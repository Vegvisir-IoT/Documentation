\section{The State Machine}
\label{sec:1}
A state machine can be generally described as an autonomous agent that is
encoded with variables to define its state. The machine transitions to
different states by when given commands. In Vegvisir, the state machine is
responsible for managing the following items:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Blockdag
    \item Block cache
    \item CRDT List
\end{enumerate}
