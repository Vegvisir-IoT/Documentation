\extrachap{Introduction}

As presented in its introductory paper\cite{karlsson2018vegvisir}, Vegvisir is
a tamperproof log that is often defined as a blockchain. It differs from other
implementations in the fact it is low powered and does not require a
stable network connectivity. In this paper, we will define 3 fundamental parts
of the Vegvir structure:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Vegvisir Core
    \item Hardware Interface
    \item Application Interface
\end{enumerate}

The \emph{Core} references the autonomous agent responsible for managing the
tamperproof log and the subsequent CRDT list. The \emph{Hardware Interface}
concerns the aspect of information transfer over a connection. This interface
is utilized by the agent to gather or send information concerning the data
structure. The \emph{Application Interface} is utilized to interact with the
log.
